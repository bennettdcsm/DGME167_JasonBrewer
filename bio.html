			<h3>
				Design Statement
			</h3>
			<p>
				I’m a Graphic Designer working in the Adobe suite and Aseprite, exploring where I can insert my creative vision. I try to focus on connecting designs aiming to connect with the message I need to bring. I’ve gotten used to using macropad with the programs I use to help with my general work flow. I’ve always been playing games, and while you’re reading this I’m probably either playing something new from the indie scene or the new Sonic. Metal Slug was probably my awakening into pixel art with how beautifully everything looks in that series. My awakening for graphic design came from many different areas, but the Danganronpa series I think was what made me interested in this path. My goal is to create designs that can speak to everyone.
